# Library-Search


## Description
This project is a MERN-stack application that integrates GraphQL with Apollo Server to replace RESTful API routes. It is a fully functioning Google Books API search engine that allows users to search for books and save them to their accounts. The app is built using a React front end, a MongoDB database, and a Node.js/Express.js server and API. The primary goal of this project is to improve performance and enhance user experience by transitioning from RESTful API to GraphQL.
